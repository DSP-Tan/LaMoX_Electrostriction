This calculation was broken up using the script "MakeFolders.sh",
roughly 3 atomic perturbations were completed per submitted job.

The times for these calculations are contained in Times.txt. The
individual calculation folders were deleted after completion, as
all the important information is in abi.ddb, which we may also 
delete, since we have the full results in anaddb.out.
